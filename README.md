# Trivial space libs

Utility functions and algorithms used throughout the trivial space projects.
They are elementary, modular and dependency free.

_This library is fluctuating a lot, changed and updated as the rest of the
trivial space projects evolves. Do not use for production applications!_

Developed and build for usage with TypeScript.
