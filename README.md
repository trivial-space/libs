# Trivial space libs

Utility functions and algorithms used throughout the trivial space projects. They are elementary, modular and dependency free.

*This library is fluctuating a lot, changed and updated as the rest of the trivial space projects evolves. Do not use for production applications!*

Developed and build for usage with TypeScript. Compiled for tree shaking with webpack or rollup.
